## 2. Reentrancy

**Severity:** High  
**File:** `src/Cred.sol`  
**Detected by:** Logician Persona

### Description

Step 1: Attacker calls batchSellShareCred or sellShareCred with valid parameters. Step 2: Contract executes several calls to external contracts and transfers ETH, triggering potential reentrancy. Step 3: Attacker re-enters the sellShareCred function before the state updates are finalized, allowing modification of internal balances or states leading to extra funds being withdrawn or unintended behavior.

## 3. Potential Oracle Manipulation via Bonding Curve Contract Calls

**Severity:** High  
**File:** `src/Cred.sol`  
**Detected by:** DeFi Risk Analyst Persona

### Description

Step 1: A malicious user exploits the ability to interact with the bonding curve contract used to determine prices for the Cred shares. Step 2: By manipulating the bonding curve's price computation or providing a price that does not reflect the actual market value (possibly via an insecure oracle or improper pricing logic in the bonding curve), the user can create/execute trades at an unfair advantage, leading to potential financial loss for the contract or other participants.
